# ParentChildJavaTask
A simple command line Java/Maven application

The maven project is located in the AltimaTask directory.

An application can be run through command-line, by providing two arguments, absolute paths to the input file and output file, separated by space.

The input file contains child and parent names in each line, as described in the task.
An output file is just a file to which you want to save your generated results.
Output is also printed to the standard output (console).

JUnit tests are located in in src/test/java directory and they can be also run through command-line (or via the green play button in IntelliJ). JUnit tests have some predefined files for testing purposes (files have descriptive names) located in src/test/resources directory. Those files can be modified to define different input scenarios and their expected output.
